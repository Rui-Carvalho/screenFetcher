README.md for *screen_fetcher* section
=====================================

### Introduction

Screen Fetcher allows you to generate screen capture snapshots from windows you may be using in you computer.
It runs on Windows boxes.

My future plan is to make the program available for Linux distributions as well. However, my first intention was to 
actually produce a windows executable to allow me to take screen shots of windows and generate pdf files and all
the functionality around such task.

### Thank you

for us.
